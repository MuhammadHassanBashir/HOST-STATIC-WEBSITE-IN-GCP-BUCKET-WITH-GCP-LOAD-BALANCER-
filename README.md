## Hosting a Static Website Using Google Cloud

    This guide provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to configure a Google Cloud Storage bucket to host a static website for a domain you own. Static websites use client-side technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but do not support server-side scripting.
    
    Since Cloud Storage alone does not provide HTTPS support for custom domains, weâ€™ll use Cloud Storage with an external Application Load Balancer to enable HTTPS. You can still serve content over HTTP without a load balancer.

## Objectives:

- Upload and share your website files.
- Set up a load balancer and an SSL certificate.
- Connect your load balancer to your Cloud Storage bucket.
- Point your domain to the load balancer using an A record.
- Test the website.

## Costs Involved:

This tutorial uses the following Google Cloud services:

- Cloud Storage
- Cloud Load Balancing
- You can monitor potential charges by reviewing Google Cloud's billing tips.

## Prerequisites:

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A Google Cloud project with billing enabled.
- The Compute Engine API enabled.
- IAM roles for Storage Admin and Compute Network Admin.
- A domain you own (or manage).
- Cloud Storage bucket for your website files (if you don't have one, create it).
- You should also have some basic files for your website, including an index.html and a 404.html page.
- (Optional) If your Cloud Storage bucket shares the same name as your domain, verify domain ownership via Cloud Domains.

## Create Your HTML Files

First, create the index.html and 404.html files. These will be used for your static website.

## index.html:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Welcome to My Website</title>
        <style>
            body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: center; padding: 50px; }
            h1 { color: #333; }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to My Static Website</h1>
        <p>This website is hosted on Google Cloud Storage.</p>
    </body>
    </html>

## 404.html:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>404 - Page Not Found</title>
        <style>
            body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: center; padding: 50px; }
            h1 { color: red; }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
        <p>Sorry, the page you're looking for doesn't exist.</p>
    </body>
    </html>

## Step 1: Upload Your Website Files

You can upload files to Cloud Storage via:

Google Cloud Console:

- Go to the Cloud Storage Buckets page in the Google Cloud Console.
- Select your bucket.
- Click Upload files and select the files to upload.

Command Line:
        
    gcloud storage cp Desktop/index.html gs://my-static-assets

Terraform:

    resource "google_storage_bucket_object" "indexpage" {
      name         = "index.html"
      content      = "<html><body>Hello World!</body></html>"
      content_type = "text/html"
      bucket       = google_storage_bucket.static_website.id
    }
